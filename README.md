1 Dev designing scrapper and inputs()
All responsible for checking their code and commenting properly

Things To Know Before Starting:
Basic knowledge of GitHub https://youtu.be/0fKg7e37bQE
If not designing UI, understanding how the data is formatted and how it is broken down, i.e. gross survey data or already calculated tables
If designing UI, determine a color pallet and general design layout, Data team will inform UI team of what data is coming from the csv files or API
If you don't already know what or how an API works, learn about them


Design Template:
UI:
Main App:
Scraper for data url
Use API’s
Unzip data file
Read data file into program
Create object with attributes to put into an array
